It is commonly used in lending/borrowing protocols, decentralized exchanges, and other DeFi applications to ensure the stability and security of the system. The primary goal of forced position liquidation is to protect the lender&#39;s interests and maintain the overall stability of the DeFi platform. It ensures that borrowers maintain an adequate level of collateral to cover their debt, reducing the risk of insolvency and potential losses for other users.</p><h2 id="algorithmic-stablecoin" tabindex="-1"><a href="./algorithmic-stablecoin">Algorithmic stablecoin</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#algorithmic-stablecoin" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Algorithmic stablecoin](algorithmic-stablecoin.md)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Pegged algorithmic stablecoins represent a subclass of cryptocurrencies designed to maintain the value by algorithmically managing supply and demand in relation to the value of a specific reference asset. Unlike traditional fiat-backed stablecoins, which are directly backed by reserve assets like US dollars, algorithmic stablecoins rely on complex algorithms and mechanisms to achieve price stability.</p><h2 id="portfolio-rebalancing" tabindex="-1"><a href="./portfolio-rebalancing">Portfolio rebalancing</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#portfolio-rebalancing" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;[Portfolio rebalancing](portfolio-rebalancing.md)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Contract-based portfolios provide the ability to automate the process of adjusting the composition of account&#39;s digital asset portfolio to maintain desired investment objectives, risk profiles, or allocations. Algorithmically-controlled rebalancing leverages smart contracts to make all adjustments, eliminating the need for manual intervention and reducing the risk of human error.</p>',7),n=[r];function l(s,c,d,h,m,p){return i(),a("div",null,n)}const g=e(t,[["render",l]]);export{u as __pageData,g as default};
